## Installation

This module is intended to be used in browserify and can therefor be installed

```

## Versioning

This module follows the versioning scheme that the swfobject uses. The major is
the major version used by the swfobject project. The minor version is also used
by the project. So swfobject 2.2 maps to 2.2.x on semver. The patch versions are
used by this library to update browserify releases, fixes and other misc
changes.
